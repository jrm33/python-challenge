# python-challenge

In this challenge we imported and created paths for both csv files (election_data.csv and budget_data.csv) for two seperate data analysis, PyBank and PyPoll. 

For PyBank we used the budget_data.csv and sorted through 86 months of data containing profit and losses for the company. The final data that we needed to obtain included the total months, net total of profit/losses, the changes and the average of those changes, as well as the greatest increase and decrease in profits over the entire period.

For PyPoll we needed to sort through the election_data.csv file to obtain information regarding the election. This information included the ballot IDs, counties, and each candidate that recieved votes. The final information that we needed to obtain included the total votes cast, complete list of the candidates that recieved votes, percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate recieved, and the winner of the election.
